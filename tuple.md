* Tuple
    * AKA: "N-Tuple"
    * Library: built-in
    * Description: An immutable sequence of values with a defined iteration order
    * What Makes it Special: The `tuple` is behind a number of common Python
    idioms including multiple assignment and returning multiple values from a
    function.
    * Construction
        * `element, element`: comma separated list of elements with or without
          enclosing parenthesis. Note the comma is the operator in this case
          (not the parentheses)
        * `tuple(iterable)`: using `tuple()` to construct a tuple from an
          iterable
    * Mutability: `immutable`
